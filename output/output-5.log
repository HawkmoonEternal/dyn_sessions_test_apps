slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 5 ON n02 CANCELLED AT 2023-01-31T21:07:48 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [prterun-n02-5635@0,0] on node n02
  Remote daemon: [prterun-n02-5635@0,3] on node n05

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
